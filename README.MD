# Overview

<!-- {Important!  Do not say in this section that this is college assignment.  Talk about what you are trying to accomplish as a software engineer to further your learning.}

{Provide a description the software that you wrote to demonstrate the Java language.}-->
I created this to demonstrate the use of Visual Studio Code, GitHub, and Java integrated .

The program is in Java that demonstrates the following: Variables, Expressions, Conditionals, Loops, Functions, Classes, Data structure from Java Collection Framework (such as ArrayList, TreeSet, or HashMap)

Java language is an object-oriented language used for embedded and application development.Java requires the use of a compiler and a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) which can both be obtained by installing the Java Development Kit (JDK). Compiled code (often with a .class or .jar extension) will run on any computer that has a JVM. Java contains a substantial library which includes many classes for data structures (Java Collection Framework), file management, and threading. In Java, every file contains a single class. A static main function is created in one of the classes and is used to provide a starting point for the program.

<!--{Describe your purpose for writing this software.}-->
I am expanding on a previous bank account program I wrote. The program is to accept new account numbers, withdraws, and credits for a bank using classes and data structure. 

<!---{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.  Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}-->
